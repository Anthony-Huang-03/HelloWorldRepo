# Roadie Rescue

Roadie Rescue provides quick assistance for non-life-threatening vehicle issues by allowing users to share their exact location and issue details. The app posts this information on a map, enabling responders or nearby civilians to quickly locate and assist stranded drivers. It also includes a guide section with troubleshooting tips, empowering users to resolve minor issues themselves.
The app addresses a common problem where drivers are unsure of their location during emergencies. By automatically pinpointing the user's exact position, Roadie Rescue ensures clear navigation for helpers. This community-driven approach allows for faster interventions, especially when first responders may not prioritize non-emergencies, enhancing road safety and reducing wait times.

## Tech Stack
In developing Roadie Rescue, we utilized the MERN stack, comprising MongoDB, Express, React, and Node, to build a robust and scalable platform. On the backend, we used Node.js and Express to create RESTful APIs, enabling CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage the data of users seeking help and those offering assistance. MongoDB was employed for data storage, ensuring the persistence and reliability of user data.

For the frontend, we leveraged React for its component-based architecture, which enhances maintainability and reusability. React components interact with the backend through Axios for API communication, ensuring a seamless flow of information between the client and server. To implement the mapping feature, we integrated Leaflet, a lightweight open-source library, which enables real-time location tracking and routing between two points, allowing users to view and navigate to the exact location of those needing assistance.

## Innovation
Roadie Rescue is an innovative solution that redefines roadside assistance by leveraging a community-driven approach and integrating cutting-edge technologies. Unlike traditional services that rely solely on first responders or insurance companies—both of which may deprioritize non-life-threatening incidents—this app empowers civilians to offer assistance, significantly reducing response times for stranded drivers. By utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and Leaflet for precise mapping and real-time routing, the app accurately pinpoints users’ locations, addressing the challenge of locating help-seekers and enhancing safety and efficiency.

The app's use of Axios for seamless API communication and React's component-based architecture ensures scalability and maintainability. A self-help guide section also empowers users to resolve minor issues themselves, combining community support, technology, and education into a comprehensive roadside assistance solution.
